Katch
=====

Katch is a desktop application that allows users to search for photos on Flickr similar in color to an image of their choosing. I, Hayden Roche,
am the sole developer of Katch at this time. Katch is written in Java and is still under development.

To Do
=====

- Refine comparison algorithm to produce better matches
- Finalize GUI
- Potentially make Katch available as a web app
- Provide means for searching more than 100 images at a time
